Line by line description of the code:

Line 1 asks the user for their name and stores their input into name.

Line 3 sets the boolean checker to false to signified that the year has not been checked to see if it is a leap year.

Line 4 is a while loop that continues to run as long as checker is false.

Lines 5 and 6 prompt you to input a year and attempts to convert the input into an int. If it can be converted, the program proceeds to line 7. If not the program excecutes lines 24 and 25.

Line 7 tests to see if year is divisible by 4. If true the program executes line 8 if not it proceeds to lines 20-23.

Line 8 tests to see if year is divisble by 100 and 400. if it is lines 9-11 are exceuted. If not lines 12-15 execute.

Lines 9 and 10 prints that the year is a leap year and tell you to enjoy the extra day.

Line 11 changes checker to true so that the loop will end.

Line 12 tests to see if the year is divisible by 100 but not 400. If the condition is true, 13-15 execute. If not lines 16-18 execute.

Lines 13 and 14 inform you that it is not a leap year.

Line 15 is the same as line 11.

Line 16 executes if both 8 and 12 return false.

Lines 17 and 18 tell you it is a leap year.

Line 19 is the same as line 11.

Line 20 executes if line 7 returns false.

Line 21 and 22 inform you that it is not a leap year.

Line 23 is the same as line 11.

Lines 24 and 25 execute if the user did not insert an int and informs you that you did not input a year. The while loop is then retested.
