This program prompts the user for a year and determines whether or not the given year is a leap year. In order for the year to be a leap year, it has to be divisible by 4. If the year is also divisible by 100, the year has to also be divisible by 400 in order for it to be a leap year. If it's only divisible by 100, but not divisible by 400, it's not a leap year. 
For example, if the user were to type in 2020, the program would respond "That is a leap year!" If they were to type in 2021, the program would print out "That is not a leap year."
