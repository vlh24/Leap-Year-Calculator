This program first prompts the user to input their name and then it greets them and tells them the purpose of the program. And then it prompts the user to input a year and determines whether or not the given year is a leap year. In order for the year to be a leap year, it has to be divisible by 4. If the year is also divisible by 100, the year has to also be divisible by 400 in order for it to be a leap year. If it's only divisible by 100, but not divisible by 400, it's not a leap year. 
For example, if the user were to type in 2020, the program would respond "That is a leap year! Enjoy the extra day, name" If they were to type in 2021, the program would print out "Unfortunately, that isn't a leap year, name."
